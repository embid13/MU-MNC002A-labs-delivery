# Monolithic Manufacturing application

* If you want to be able to debug the app,
or you don't know anything about **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**, 
you can install **PyCharm IDE** and follow **Running Monolithic application using PyCharm IDE**.
* If you want to use **Docker** and **Docker-Compose**,
you can follow **Running Monolithic application using docker-compose**.


## Running Monolithic application using PyCharm IDE

* If you have a project opened: ```File > Close project```.
* If you have GitLab access:
  * Click ```Get from Version Control``` and put
*https://gitlab.danz.eus/macc/cloud-computing/advanced-software-architectures/aas/monolithic.git*
as repository.
* If you don't have gitlab access:
  * Unzip the ZIP file and open it using PyCharm.
* Once the project is loaded, create a virtual environment (**venv**) at ```File > Settings > Project: monolithic > Python Interpreter```.
* Set ```fastapi_app > monolithic``` as Sources root (right click on folder, ```Marc Directory as > Sorces Root```)
* Add the packages in ```fastapi_app > monolithic > requirements.txt``` to de **venv**.
  * in the terminal (usually at the bottom of the IDE) ```cd fastapi_app/monolithic```
  * Then install dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Click ```OK``` button.
* Copy environment variables to needed folder:
  * Right click on ```dot_env_exam``` file.
  * Paste it inside ```fastapi_app > monolithic``` and name it as ```.env```.
* Run or Debug main.py

You can continue with **Understanding the repository** and **REST API Method** points in this readme.

## Running Monolithic application with docker-compose

* Create aas folder and clone repository from GitLab:

```bash
mkdir aas
cd aas
git clone https://gitlab.danz.eus/macc/cloud-computing/advanced-software-architectures/aas/monolithic.git
cd delivery
```

* If you don't have GitLab access, download zip from MuDLE, unzipit and enter the folder.

```bash
cd delivery-master
```

* Copy enviroment variables to .env file:

```bash
cp dot_env_example .env
```

* Launch monolithic application using docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Help on docker commands

* Launch docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f "file" up
```

or (if there is a docker-compose.yml file in the current folder)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

* If you want to run it in the background (daemon) add ```-d```:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

* View running containers:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

* Stop one of the containers:

```bash
docker-compose stop <container-name>

docker-compose stop monolithicapp
```

* Stop docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f "file" down
```

or (if there is a docker-compose.yml file in the current folder)

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Understanding this repository

### Docker related files

* **```docker-compose.yml```**: indicates the images/containers the application has,
which port to use...
* **```dot_env_example```**: it has to be copied (and renamed to *.env*) to the needed path 
for the application to know environment variables
* **```fastapi_app > Dockerfile```**: it has the docker commands to create the image with 
our FastAPI application and needed Dependencies. I also defines that when the container is run,
```uvicorn``` server has to be executed.

### Monolithic (```fastapi_app > monolithic```)

* **```main.py```**: the main function that will initiate the FastAPI application.
* **```requirements.txt```**: The dependencies that are needed to execute the application. 
The Dockerfile will execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install them
when we build the image.

### Application (```fastapi_app > monolithic > app```)

* **```dependencies.py```**: Functions to inject dependencies to FastAPI (e.g. DB Session).
This is very interesting, for example, when you want to use a different database for testing.
* **```business_logic/async_machine.py```**: This is the coroutine that will simulate the manufacturing
process. It includes functions to manage pieces and a queue of pieces to manufacture.
* **```routers/main_router.py```**: contains the REST API endpoint definitions for the application:
  GET, POST, DELETE... You could separate this in multiple files.
* **```routers/router_utils.py```**: contains different router utility functions that could be used
in different routers.
* **```sql/crud.py```**: this file contains the functions that access the database.
* **```sql/database.py```**: this file contains the database configuration.
* **```sql/models.py```**: this file contains the mapping between Python Objects and database 
tables.
* **```sql/schemas.py```**: this file contains the schema definitions for endpoint request and
responses (e.g. defines the json structure for the request/responses of the app).

## REST API Methods

One of the main advantages of FastAPI is that it creates the API documentation automatically if 
you do it right. Execute the application and open 
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
Open that page, so you can see the endpoints of the app. You could test how it works from there.

Nevertheless, we recommend to install an application to test the REST APIs. e.g.:

* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (Free, you can program environment variables)
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) (Free and OpenSource + PRO Version)
* [SOAP UI](https://www.soapui.org/) (Free and OpenSource + PRO Version)

The following methods can be extracted from 
```fastapi_app > monolithic > app > routers > main_router.py``` annotations.

If you execute the app in your IDE, the host will be *localhost*.

## Create an order [POST]

* URL: *http://localhost:13000/order*
* Body:

```json
{
  "description": "New order created from REST API",
  "number_of_pieces": 5
}
```

## View an Order [GET]:

You can get the ID when you create the order.
* URL: *http://localhost:13000/order/{id}*

## Remove an Order [DELETE]:

You can get the ID when you create the order.
* URL: *http://localhost:13000/order/{id}*

The order will be deleted and the un-manufactured pieces will be removed from the machine queue.
All the un-manufactured pieces of the order will appear as *"Cancelled"* and the order_id
will be *null*.

### View all Orders [GET]:

* URL: *http://localhost:13000/order*

### View Machine Status [GET]:

You can see the queue, the status of the machine and the piece that is being manufactured.
* URL: *http://localhost:13000/machine/status*

### View a Piece [GET]:

You can get the ID when you create the order.
* URL: *http://localhost:13000/piece/{id}*

### View all Pieces [GET]:

* URL: *http://localhost:13000/piece*
